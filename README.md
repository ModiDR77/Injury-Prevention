# Project Name 
Short description of project.

Project Notes:

- Please remember to keep your repo private when you create it from this template.
- Be sure to create your report in the **intro-gen-ai** organization. 
- The name of the repo should be the name of the project, or a shortened version of the name.
- Each section should be completed by the deadline indicated. You submit by making a commit of this README.md file. Except for minor edits, please do no change the Proposal, Goals, or Metrics sections after the submission deadline.
- General guidance on formatting writing in markdown files (like this README.md file) is at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax.
- There is a [recording of the the class discussion on the use of this template](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/rec/share/RjihScz0Ti7RId0KMj7GWBc8XueS571_JnFqDQwli0AuKLsgaau0j_RcphBjwYtV.HP10ROf2TwPUn6TA?startTime=1697553005000).
- You can sign up for a time to discuss your ideas for the project at https://calendly.com/jesse-spencer-smith. We'll also be discussing project in class on Tuesday after Fall Break.
- Remember that there is an AI Showcase on December 1 (with prizes for Best in Show), so you might want to consider completing your project by then.

## Project Proposal 
**Due October 26, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words total across all of the sections below

### Description of Problem/Opportunity
Over the course of a sports season, athletes are at risk of injuries due to various factors, such as repeating certain movements, being frequently targeted in vulnerable positions, fatigue-induced errors, and the cumulative stress of back-to-back games. Recognizing and understanding these patterns early can significantly aid in preventing potential injuries and ensuring athlete longevity.


### Proposed Solution/Approach
Using historical game data and player movement patterns, we aim to develop a predictive model that identifies moments of heightened injury risk for athletes during matches. This would involve analyzing sequences where injuries commonly occur and recognizing similar patterns in real-time gameplay. By introducing a tailored prompt system, the model can then provide timely alerts or recommendations to coaching staff, potentially preventing situations that lead to injuries.


### Project Outline and Timeline
What are the steps to complete the project? State your milestones and the dates you want to complete them. 
Milestone #1 - Utilize a combination of acquiring data sets and synthesizing data sets in order to establish a solid foundation
Milestone #2 - Identify the right machine learning algorithms and predictive patterns needed to analyze the data
Milestone #3 - Use chatgpt to train our synthetic data using these machine learning algorithms and predictive patterns
Final Milestone - Employ our finished algorithm and assess the results


## Goals of project 
**Due October 26, 11:59pm**

Describe 1-5 goals of the project. 
Goal 1: Understand patterns behind players injuries. Asses whether certain speeds, movements, positions, etc make players more prone to injuries. 
Goal 2: Use our findings to provide preventative solutions to players more susceptible to injuries. 
Goal 3: Enhance in-game decision making and player load management

## Project Metrics 
**Due October 26, 11:59pm**

Compose 2-5 metrics to determine the success of the project. These should be measureable, and should translate to a letter grade for each. 
Metric 1: Our model correctly predicts whether a player is at risk for injury when given unfamiliar testing data
Metric 2: Unbiased, third party sources such as coaches or teachers assess our model to be fair and accurate


## Self-Evaluation
**Due December 8, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words

Address each of the goals, and assess each of the metrics. Include a statement on each on what you achieved or did not achieve, give support for your assessments.

## Reflection on Learning
**Due December 8, 11:59pm**

500-1000 words

What do you take away from the project? Has this changed how you understand AI? Does and how does this affect future plans for learning, work, or otherwise?

## What's Next?
**Due December 8, 11:59pm**

100-500 words

Do you plan on continuing the project? What will you do with what you've learning?
