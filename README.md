## Project Proposal 
Over the course of a sports season, athletes are at risk of injuries due to various factors, such as repeating certain movements, being frequently targeted in vulnerable positions, fatigue-induced errors, and the cumulative stress of back-to-back games. Recognizing and understanding these patterns early can significantly aid in preventing potential injuries and ensuring athlete longevity.


### Proposed Solution/Approach
Using historical game data and player movement patterns, we aim to develop a predictive model that identifies moments of heightened injury risk for athletes during matches. This would involve analyzing sequences where injuries commonly occur and recognizing similar patterns in real-time gameplay. By introducing a tailored prompt system, the model can then provide timely alerts or recommendations to the coaching staff, potentially preventing situations that lead to injuries.


### Project Outline and Timeline
Milestone #1 - Utilize a combination of acquiring data sets and synthesizing data sets in order to establish a solid foundation
Milestone #2 - Identify the right machine learning algorithms and predictive patterns needed to analyze the data
Milestone #3 - Use chatgpt to train our synthetic data using these machine learning algorithms and predictive patterns
Final Milestone - Employ our finished algorithm and assess the results


## Goals of project 
Goal 1: Understand patterns behind players injuries. Asses whether certain speeds, movements, positions, etc make players more prone to injuries. 
Goal 2: Use our findings to provide preventative solutions to players more susceptible to injuries. 
Goal 3: Enhance in-game decision making and player load management

## Project Metrics  
Metric 1: Our model correctly predicts whether a player is at risk for injury when given unfamiliar testing data
Metric 2: Unbiased, third-party sources such as coaches or teachers assess our model to be fair and accurate


## Self-Evaluation
Our first metric was to see if the model should accurately predict whether a player is at risk for injury when presented with unfamiliar testing data. This goal was met as after we trained the data we used a test set to determine the accuracy. Our model was very accurate at predicting whether a player would get injured or not on the test set which we used unfamiliar data for. Furthermore, when we did our own user inputs the model was very accurate. We further compared these metrics to data of NBA players and it was accurate when putting in specific stats of players who got injured and who did not. We used methods such as cross-validation to ensure we had an accurate test set. Our second metric was to see if external parties such as coaches or teachers could assess the model as fair and accurate. This goal has not yet been met as our assignment has not been submitted and we have not reached out to coaches. This goal will be further discussed in the “Next Steps” section. 

Our first goal was to understand patterns behind players' injuries and assess whether certain speeds, movements, positions, etc make players more prone to injuries. This goal was not met as we were unable to find the data. We spent hours looking on the internet and even reached out to professional and college basketball teams. No teams wanted to provide us with the data as it was confidential to the players and the teams. We also tried to synthesize it with ChatGPT, but were unsuccessful in doing so. Our next goal was also not met for the same reasons. We were not able to understand which players were susceptible to injury based on their movements in games. Our last goal was slightly met. The first part about in-game decision-making was not met, but the aspect about load management was met. Since some of the variables that were used in our model included games played we were easily able to extract information regarding those. Games played and minutes played were the second and third most important variables leading to players getting injured. Though we were not able to meet our prior goals, our project still provides lots of insight into players who are susceptible to injury and how fatigue, age, and scoring all have an effect on that. 

## Reflection on Learning
Through countless tries and failing in our project, we have come to better understand Artificial Intelligence and how to utilize it to the best of its abilities. One of the most significant takeaways from our experience is the realization that AI’s potential amplifies with the time and effort invested into it. As we attempted to build our predictive model for athlete injury risk, we discovered that AI's effectiveness is greatly enhanced if one is patient and persistent. 
This is crucial learning for the future as it is insightful to know that AI will be much more helpful to us if we are dedicated and thorough in our AI-driven projects. 

When we first started the project we underestimated the usefulness of AI because of its limited knowledge of datasets and up to date news. However, this project revealed AI's adaptability and its ability to produce varied outcomes despite these limitations. We were able to use AI to create synthesized data in order to test our model on. Additionally, AI was able to merge data sets that we gave to it with a high level of effectiveness. This was a big takeaway for us because we learned that the combination of public data sets and AI can be very powerful for predictive modeling and data synthesis. 

Another big takeaway we had from the project was learning how to make our AI assistant interactable. In previous assignments we had built certain models or done assignments using ai but they were not interactable for another user. In order to make our AI assistant interactable we coded an interface that allows the user to input in player biometrics and statistics in order to get an injury risk percentage. This was very cool to create as it makes the AI functional for solving real world problems. 

Lastly, we both learned how much more effective and efficient the use of AI can be when one has a high level of knowledge of the project matter. We both have a great understanding of sports and sports injuries because we both play sports and watch a lot of them. This allowed us to help AI to disregard some of the statistics we fed it and prioritize others for the model. Our background knowledge paired well with AI in order to maximize the predictive power of the model. All in all, this taught us that we should not dive into AI-enhanced projects without first having a deep understanding of the problem at hand. 

Looking ahead, we aim to utilize the combination of public data sets and AI in order to synthesize data and perform predictive modeling. This newfound knowledge will enable us to carry out any project we want as long as we have access to accurate data, an understanding of the material, and the time to dedicate to refining our AI assistant. This will not only help us with challenging projects in the workplace, but also with projects of our choice that are personally interesting to us. This might involve more sports related projects or other interests such as environmental research. Ultimately, this experience has both enhanced our understanding of AI and opened doors to possibilities for future use cases. With AI’s influence on the world growing larger everyday, this learning will prepare us to reach personal and professional goals. 


## What's Next?
Data Enrichment: To enhance the model's predictive power, we plan to integrate additional datasets, including more nuanced player movement data and environmental factors, which could offer deeper insights into injury causation.

Model Evolution: Experimentation with advanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning. The ability of neural networks to capture complex patterns could be pivotal in uncovering subtle injury predictors.

Real-Time Analytics: A significant goal is to develop a system that can provide real-time injury risk assessments during games, allowing for immediate decision-making that could prevent injury occurrences.

Educational Outreach: Partnering with sports organizations and educational institutions to share knowledge and tools, enabling them to use data analytics effectively in reducing injury risks.
